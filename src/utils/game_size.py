"""Game sizes the tool is built and tested for, and what happens on others.

A player on 2026-10-09 ran the game in a smaller window: the tool started
anyway (ok-script accepts any 16:9 size from 1280x720 up), the shrunken
cartridge numbers and buttons were never recognised, and 跑图 slid the
cartridge bar and clicked the map's back button for minutes on end.  Leo
(2026-10-09) chose 「提醒但照跑」, then asked for it to be solved, not only
warned about (the player's window was 1467x824).  So a run first sets the
game to 1920x1080 itself, the way 首页「游戏视窗大小」「调整」 does, and
warns only when that cannot be done (a screen smaller than 1920x1080).
