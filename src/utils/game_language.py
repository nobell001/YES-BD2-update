"""Tell the player when the game itself is set to Traditional Chinese.

Every keyword the tool reads is the 简中 client's text (OCR 只识别简体中文,
2026-08-29).  A player on the 繁中 client (YES-BD2 issue #3, 2026-10-09)
saw the tool stop at the home check with no hint why.  Leo (2026-10-09)
chose to warn for now and support 繁中 later: the home checks note the text
they read, and a run that fails after 繁中 text was seen says to switch the
game to 简体中文.
