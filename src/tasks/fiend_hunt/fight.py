"""Replay a saved 魔兽追踪者 fight turn by turn.

Each turn: read TURN, look up the saved turn, read who stands where,
then switch team / swap the order / drag / pick skills until the screen
matches the save, and only then press BATTLE.  Anything unexpected (a
turn the save doesn't have, a death, a screen that can't be read, a fix
that doesn't take) stops the fight before BATTLE and hands it back to the
player: 认不准就不按.

The screen itself is behind ``FightScreen`` so this loop has no capture
or mouse code and can be tested against a simulated battle.

Reading the whole screen means tapping every list slot for the names and
holding cells, which is too slow to do several times a turn: a replay has
to stay under 5 minutes (Leo) and the battles take about half of that.  A
screen that also offers ``QuickChecks`` is read in full only when
something changed that the tool didn't do itself: the first turn, a death,
a new list entry, a team switch, or a check that failed.  Otherwise a turn
starts from how the previous one was left, and before BATTLE every living
unit's cell is held to confirm it lights that unit's list slot, so a unit
the battle did move is still caught.  After a full read, only the units
the tool then moved or re-ordered are confirmed again.  Most bosses never
move anyone (Leo 2026-10-06: one in a year of play did), so unless the
player ticks that the boss pushes (``pushes``), carried-over cells are
held only before a drag touches them and after the tool moved them.

The action cards (attack or skill, see turn_plan) are checked last, once
the grid and the order are right.  The left list shows each unit's card:
its portrait turns into the costume whose skill is up, with a round skill
icon top-right, and an attack has no such icon (seen 2026-09-30 on the 4K
PC).  So on a recorded turn, which has a screenshot, each unit to check is
compared with its entry in the saved screenshot, all from one capture;
only a unit that looks different is fixed, by picking its cards until it
looks as saved (Leo's idea).  A chart has no screenshot: there the unit's
list slot is asked for its card and the saved one picked where it
differs.  Either way attacks go before skills, so the SP they free is
there for the skills.  ``check_card`` limits whose cards are checked,
e.g. ``summons_only`` when the player set the characters' attack or skill
in the costume order; the saved 爆发 levels are set for everyone either way.
