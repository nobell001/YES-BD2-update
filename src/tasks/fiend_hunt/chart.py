"""A saved fight as a turn chart, like a souseha formation page (Leo 2026-10-06).

For each turn: the 1-N order with each unit's portrait, card (攻击 / 技能 /
击退) and 爆发 level, and the grid with who stands where.  Portraits are cut
from the save's own screenshots (the list entry's portrait), so a costume
or character the souseha list lacks still shows.  A card the record didn't
keep is read off the screenshot: a round skill icon on the portrait means a
skill, none an attack; the 爆发 level from the entry's flame.  Nothing here
touches the game.
