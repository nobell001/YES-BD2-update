"""The live 魔兽追踪者 planning screen, for replay_fight and record_fight.

Reading a turn (top-down view, nobody selected to start with):
  * TURN on the BATTLE pill, TEAM1/TEAM2 top-left, how many list slots
    are filled and which of them say OUT (dead units drop to the bottom);
  * who stands where: holding a unit's cell selects it, which puts white
    brackets round its list portrait (that is its slot in the 1-N order)
    and its name top-left, and opens its card column (the chosen card is
    lit).  One hold gives cell, slot, name and action together.
    Cells are held in a useful order (where the units were last seen or
    are expected, then busy-looking cells) and holding stops as soon as
    every living slot has been found, so a turn usually costs one hold
    per unit instead of twelve.  A slot found twice, a name that doesn't
    snap to a known unit, or slots left over after all twelve cells
    raise ScreenReadError: 认不准就不按.

Checking cards on a recorded turn (same_card): one capture of the list,
taken with nobody selected once no entry is being swept by the glow that
follows a pick, answers every slot against the same slot of the saved
screenshot; any mouse action drops it, so a comparison after a pick sees
the new card.

Moves are posted mouse messages with the cursor following them, the way
BD2Interaction.post_swipe does, because the game samples the cursor.
