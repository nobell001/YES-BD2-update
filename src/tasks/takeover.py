"""Stop the running task as soon as the user takes over the game.

The tool clicks by posting messages to the game window, so the real mouse and
keyboard belong to the user.  A real click, wheel turn or key press on the
game while a one-time task runs means the user took over (users do this
within seconds of anything looking stuck): the task is stopped the way the
Stop button does it, so the tool never fights the user for the game.

Ignored:
- our own real input (sale-list drags, WASD walking): Windows flags it as
  injected;
- anything in other windows: the tool is meant to run in the background;
- a click that only brings the game to the front (it was behind another
  window when pressed);
- mouse movement alone, F1-F24 (ok's Start/Stop hotkey is F9) and PrintScreen;
- anything on the 桌面分身 (input reaches the clone only by accident);
- any input while the running task says the player plays along
  (``player_plays_along``, e.g. recording a 魔兽追踪者 fight).
