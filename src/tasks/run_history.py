"""Persisted per-task run records backing the quest-style UI metadata.

The task cards and the daily board banner need "上次完成 · 今天 09:12" style
information, which the framework does not track.  This module records the most
recent finished run of every one-time task into a small JSON file and derives
"completed today / this week" from the game's Beijing-time refresh anchors
(daily 08:00, weekly Monday 08:00, UTC+8).

Batch tasks (一键完成日常) run their children through ``task.run()`` directly,
so the executor never emits ``task_done`` for them.  ``record_task_done``
therefore fans a batch record out into per-child records using the batch's
``info`` lists (完成/失败/跳过), making a child finished inside the batch count
the same as running it standalone.
