"""桌面分身 from the buttons: one press runs a task on the clone desktop.

Leo (2026-10-03, 10:28) found it too many steps to open the tool, then the
tool in the clone, then the game, then leave fullscreen; at 10:37 he asked
for no mode switch, just a separate start button on 首页 that reminds first
and then goes in (前往).  前往 opens the clone, starts the tool there and
hands it that one task; the tool in the clone opens the game itself and runs
it.  The tool outside stays open to show progress, reports and settings
(13:04), but does not start tasks while the clone's tool runs.

The start button is the only trigger: the job is a one-shot file that the
tool in the clone reads, and deletes before starting, only within ten minutes
of the press.  A tool opened any other way never starts anything by itself (Leo
removed every auto-run on opening, 2026-10-03).
